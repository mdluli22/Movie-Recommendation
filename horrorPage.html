            <td>Few names in horror fiction are as beloved as Edgar Allen Poe, but The Pale Blue Eye isn't a typical adaptation of one of his most famous works. Instead, Scott Cooper's chilly murder mystery casts Poe (Harry Melling) as a supporting character in the story of the mysterious deaths of several cadets at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Cooper reunites with Christian Bale after 2017's Hostiles, who delivers another outstanding, reserved performance as the grizzled detective Augustus Landor. While The Pale Blue Eye begins as a straightforward investigative thriller, Cooper incorporates elements of gothic horror as the murders get more gruesome. While it may not pack a lot of jump scares, the shocking ending is the type of real horror that will stick with you far after the credits have rolled.</td>

            <td>Killer dolls have been done in horror many times over the decades. Chucky and Annabelle anyone? It takes a unique concept to create a film with a similar villain and not have it come off as a clone. M3GAN succeeds at standing on its own by creating a character we've never seen before. M3GAN (Amie Donald and Jenna Davis) is a life-sized A.I. doll programmed to speak and walk like a real person. Her implanted purpose is to be a friend for a recently orphaned child, but she takes her mission a little too seriously and ends up becoming overprotective to the point of murder.</td>

            <td>Two children wake up in the middle of the night to find their father is missing, and all the windows and doors in their home have vanished. Telling what could be a simple story of two siblings who find themselves trapped in their home after all the windows and doors vanish, it thrives in its precise presentation that is unlike anything else out there. Specifically, it is a very restrained yet no less riveting work of horror where what we don't see is just as scary as what we do. Taking place entirely in this single location that increasingly feels as though it has been removed from time and space, it plunges into the darkness that threatens to swallow you whole. As voices begin to echo throughout the house and figures appear where there were once none, it settles into a rhythm that is as mesmerizing as it is maddening.</td>

            <td>What is it that you like to experience on vacation? Perhaps it is to see the sights, try the local food, or just get a chance to relax. That is unless you are one of the depraved characters in Brandon Cronenberg’s Infinity Pool where you go to get away with gruesome acts of violence before gleefully observing your clone get executed in your place. You know, just normal vacation stuff that we all love. Any other information about the experience of this film would spoil the fun but suffice it to say that there are macabre revelations to be found in this darkly delightful work.</td>

            <td>Valeria has long dreamed about becoming a mother. After learning that she's pregnant, she expects to feel happy, yet something's off. Huesera: The Bone Woman uses the titular supernatural entity to explore the pleasures and pains of motherhood in a raw (and sometimes cruel) fashion. Michelle Garza Cervera's directorial feature debut should already be celebrated for its ambition alone. Still, those willing to explore this Spanish-language horror story will discover that Huesera also has much to say about family expectations, the material challenges people face in Latin countries, and what it means for a woman to be free in a patriarchal society. </td>

            <td>Based on the popular novel The Cabin at the End of the World by Paul Tremblay, Knock at the Cabin is M. Night Shyamalan’s best film in years. What starts out as a typical home invasion thriller, with a group of four villains breaking into a family’s vacation cabin, soon turns into something else when the baddies tell their victims that one of them must sacrifice their life or the world will come to an end. It makes for some nerve-wracking suspenseful scenes, as the family fights back against their captors, and escalating events leave the audience wondering if the group is telling the truth about their actions or if they are there for other nefarious means. It all leads to a highly impactful and emotional finale.</td>

            <td>We don’t know about you, but we can’t think of anything that has provided such a unique twist on the found footage genre quite like The Outwaters. Though it takes a while to fully build to its thrilling and terrifying descent into madness, the destination that awaits is more than worth the wait. The story begins with a group of friends who are going out in the desert to shoot a music video. When they arrive there, they begin to notice that something isn't right. There are strange sounds that echo from within the Earth itself and there is soon a figure of some kind that seems like it may be familiar. Before they can figure out what is happening, their entire world is upended into one of cyclical violence that feels almost unbound from reality itself. </td>

            <td>While 2022’s Scream was a solid new take on Wes Craven’s legendary horror franchise, it was clearly just a stepping stone for filmmakers Tyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin to get adjusted to the saga. Scream VI is a fully baked vision, adding in metatextual commentary on the continuation of “legacy sequels” with more probing analysis of victimization and the perception of public tragedies. Not only is Scream VI easily the most violent film in the series thus far, but it’s also the most relentless. Two hours might seem like a stretch considering how short some of the earlier installments in the Scream series were, but Scream VI never loses a moment of tension as it seamlessly unravels its mystery.</td>

            <td>A twisted tale of two estranged sisters whose reunion is cut short by the rise of flesh-possessing demons, thrusting them into a primal battle for survival as they face the most nightmarish version of family imaginable. It took ten years for the Evil Dead franchise to return to theaters, but Evil Dead Rise is worth the wait. Written and directed by Lee Cronin (The Hole in the Ground), Evil Dead Rise brings the Deadites back in a movie that mixes the unrelenting brutality of Fede Álvarez’s semi-remake with the goofy violence of Sam Raimi's original trilogy. As a result, Evil Dead Rise is a crowdpleaser that knows precisely when to make the public laugh and when to scar our minds forever.</td>

            <td>The latest film from Rob Savage, whose breakout hit Host still holds up even if his follow-up feature Dashcam does not, the upcoming horror The Boogeyman is an effectively frightening adaptation of the Stephen King short story of the same name. Centered around Sadie Harper ( Yellowjackets ' Sophie Thatcher) as she tries to deal with both the recent loss of her mother and an unwelcome houseguest that seems to have taken up residence in her home, it is at its best when it plays into our fear of what this unknown monster might be. Specifically, the scenes with flashing lights providing small slivers of what is coming to haunt the characters are where it is at its most unsettling.</td>
