            <td>Alien invasion horror thrillers are so abundant that they tend to blend together. So, when one as special as No One Will Save You comes along, it stands out even more. Starring Kaitlyn Dever as an anxiety-ridden homebody, it sees its protagonist having to battle an alien who has found its way into her home. With pretty much no dialogue, the movie is practically a modern silent film, something audiences don't see too often nowadays.</td>

            <td>On repeated occasions, Netflix has proved to be king when it comes to streaming sci-fi television projects. They are not to be underestimated when it comes to sci-fi films either, as this year's exceptional dark comedy They Cloned Tyrone proves. In it, a series of eerie events thrust an unlikely trio onto the trail of a sinister government conspiracy.</td>

            <td>Shot on location on a modest budget and with many behind-the-scenes technological innovations, The Creator is the kind of sci-fi film that could make any movie fan say, "They don't make them like this anymore." It tells the story of a hardened ex-special forces agent who, amid a war between humans and artificial intelligence, is recruited to hunt down and kill the elusive architect of humanity's enemies.</td>

            <td>After a notoriously difficult production for an MCU project, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 finally came out in 2023 to the excited acclaim of critics and fans. It sees Peter Quill rallying his team to defend the universe and one of their own, a mission that could prove to be the end of the Guardians if unsuccessful. Without a doubt the best entry in the franchise since Avengers: Endgame, Guardians 3 is an emotional roller coaster the likes of which Marvel cinema has never seen.</td>

Asteroid City is an eccentric sci-fi dramedy following a writer in his famous fictional play about a grieving father traveling to a small rural town, where his world view is disrupted forever.</td>

            <td>Fans of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles haven't exactly been treated to many exceptional silver-screen adaptations of the iconic reptile action team; Mutant Mayhem came to change that. With highly stylized animation reminiscent of the Spider-Verse movies, it follows the titular turtle brothers as they work to earn the love of New York City while facing an army of mutants.</td>

            <td>There have been a few successful Hollywood adaptations, but, at the end of the day, Godzilla is a concept tightly tied to Japan's cultural identity; thus, the King of Monsters is usually at his best when in his country of origin. Godzilla Minus One sees everyone's favorite gigantic city-destroyer attacking post-war Japan at its lowest point, forcing a surviving Kamikaze pilot to come to terms with his guilt to save his country.</td>

            <td>Since the moment it came out, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse was hailed as one of the best animated movies of the 21st century, and rightfully so. Thus, a lot of pressure was on its sequel's shoulders. Not only did Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse live up to expectations, but it greatly surpassed them, even improving on a lot of elements of its predecessor. It continues Miles Morales's story as he catapults across the multiverse, clashing with a team of Spider-People charged with protecting reality itself.</td>
